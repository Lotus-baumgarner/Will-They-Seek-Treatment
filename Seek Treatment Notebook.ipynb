    "# Will They Seek Treatment for a Mental Illness?\n",
    "\n",
    "__By Lotus Baumgarner__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to build a predictive model to determine if someone would seek treatment for a mental illness or not. This project means a lot to me because I have close friends and family members who deal with mental illness. Some did seek treatment, while others are either not seeking it, or I feel would be a lot better off if they sought treatment sooner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mental Illness is a real issue in the United States but too many people do not want to talk about it or even admit it. Sometimes they feel it is a weakness or that nobody would understand. Sometimes they just do not know where to start. Some even feel like it is so over dramatized now a days, they do not want to be just part of the hype. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, I want to gear this project towards everyday friends and family members who feel someone close to them may be struggling with a mental illness. My motivation for this project is to hopefully deploy a model to help people recognize those who need treatment but will not seek it for themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Set:\n",
    "I decided to work with the Mental Health Dataset from Kaggle. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/mental-health-dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The features are all clear and defined and the overall data looks clean. The data is in a CSV format. It consists of just under 300,000 rows and 17 columns. The data types are all objects and are mostly strings or booleans. \n",
    "I do have some frequency counts and I am already planning to drop the Timestamps column, keep only the United States cases, and I am most likely going to simply drop the nulls from Self Employed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Column Explanations:\n",
    "1. __Timestamp__ - Time survey was submitted.\n",
    "2. __Gender__ - Respondent's Gender.\n",
    "3. __Country__ - Respondent's Country.\n",
    "4. __Occupation__ - Respondent's Occupation.\n",
    "5. __Self Employed__ - Whether the Respondent is self-employed.\n",
    "6. __Family History__ - Whether there is a family history of mental health issues.\n",
    "7. __Treatment__ - Whether the Respondent sought treatment for mental health issues.\n",
    "8. __Days Indoors__ - Number of days Respondent spends inside.\n",
    "9. __Growing Stress__ - Whether the Respondent is experiencing growing stress.\n",
    "10. __Changes Habits__ - Whether the Respondent has changed their eating or sleeping habits.\n",
    "11. __Mental Health History__ - Whether the Respondent has a history of mental health issues.\n",
    "12. __Mood Swings__ - The frequency of mood swings experienced by the Respondent.\n",
    "13. __Coping Struggles__ - Whether the Respondent struggles to cope with daily problems/stress.\n",
    "14. __Work Interest__ - Whether the Respondent has lost interest in work.\n",
    "15. __Social Interest__ - Whether the Respondent feels socially weak.\n",
    "16. __Mental Health Interview__ - Willingness to discuss mental health in an interview.\n",
    "17. __Care Options__ - Respondent's awareness of mental health care options available?"
