# Will-They-Seek-Treatment
   A model that can predict whether someone would seek treatment for a mental illness on their own.

## Business Understanding:
   Mental Illness is a real issue in the United States but too many people do not want to talk about it or admit it. Sometimes they feel it is a weakness or that nobody would understand. Sometimes they just do not know where to start. Some even feel like it is so over dramatized now a days, they do not want to be just part of the hype.
   
   My goal is to build a predictive model to determine if someone would seek treatment for a mental illness or not. This project means a lot to me because I have close friends and family members who deal with mental illness. Some did seek treatment did seek treatment on their own, while others needed a little encouragement and to know they were not alone.
   
   So, I geared this project towards everyday friends and family members who feel someone close to them may be struggling with a mental illness. My motivation for this project is to hopefully deploy a model to help people recognize those who need treatment but will not seek it for themselves. 
   
   
## Dataset:
   I decided to work with the Mental Health Dataset from Kaggle.
